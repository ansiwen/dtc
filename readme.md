# PKCS11-Compatible Distributed Threshold Cryptography Library Signer

A Golang rework of [our C++ Library](https://github.com/niclabs/tchsm-libdtc) in Golang, but using a PKCS#11 interface.

This library requires the use of two or more instances of [dtcnode](https://github.com/niclabs/dtcnode).

You can find all installation information on [the project wiki](https://github.com/niclabs/dtc/wiki).
